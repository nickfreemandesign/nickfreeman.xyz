            "description": "<p>Restek provides real time responder information during an emergency event. Unlike traditional emergency response and firefighter performance software, Restek captures critical data points relevant to first responders during an emergency response which drives performance, eliminates manual entry, and prioritizes safety through situational awareness.</p><p>Multiple presentation layers were utilized in Restek- most notable being the dispatch progressive web app for mobile users as well as the desktop app for fire administration. With usage in the dispatch layer funnelling information to the administrative layer, fire personnel were able to both communicate during an emergency in real-time while gather stats about their response outcome after the response concluded.</p><p>This project was built to scale. Using best practices in Service Oriented Architecture, Restek’s core involved a message bus which would coordinate the various dispatch feeds with the departments registered on a pub-sub basis to receive feeds relevant to them.</p>",
